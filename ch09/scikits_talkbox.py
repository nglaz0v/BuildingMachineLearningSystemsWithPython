    -------

        Mel-cepstrum coefficients

    Notes
    -----
    MFCC are computed as follows:
        * Pre-processing in time-domain (pre-emphasizing)
        * Compute the spectrum amplitude by windowing with a Hamming window
        * Filter the signal in the spectral domain with a triangular
        filter-bank, whose filters are approximatively linearly spaced on the
        mel scale, and have equal bandwith in the mel scale
        * Compute the DCT of the log-spectrum
